                            delved into this powerful image editing software, I was initially overwhelmed by the
                            plethora of tools and features it offers. However, through patient experimentation and
                            online tutorials, I've gradually grown comfortable with its vast toolkit. </h3>

                            game design and code initially seemed intimidating, as I immersed myself in Unity's
                            tutorials and documentation, I started to uncover its strong powers and went from several
                            scratch projects to producing my first 2D platformer adventure, which even my teachers found
                            admirable. </h3>
